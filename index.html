                learningObjective: "LO1 (Cell Structure): Describe the basic ultrastructure of a prototypical human cell, identify the chief organelles and major components of the cytoplasm...",
                question: "A 4-year-old boy is diagnosed with I-cell disease (mucolipidosis II). This condition is caused by a failure to add a mannose-6-phosphate marker to hydrolytic enzymes in the Golgi apparatus. As a result, these enzymes are incorrectly secreted from the cell instead of being delivered to their target organelle. Which organelle's function is most directly impaired in this patient?",
                options: { A: "Peroxisome", B: "Lysosome", C: "Mitochondrion", D: "Smooth Endoplasmic Reticulum", E: "Proteasome" },
                correctAnswer: "B",
                rationale: "I-cell disease is a lysosomal storage disease. The mannose-6-phosphate tag targets acid hydrolases to the lysosome. Without this tag, the enzymes are missorted, leaving the lysosomes non-functional. Peroxisomal and mitochondrial enzymes use different import pathways. SER is involved in lipid metabolism. Proteasomes degrade cytosolic proteins.",
                source: "Source (Cell Structure, Page 9): 'LYSOSOMES are filled with hydrolytic enzymes... These enzymes are synthesized in RER and get processed and packaged in Golgi.' The Clinical Relevance box on the same page notes: 'Improper targeting of enzymes to the lysosomes or genetic defects in lysosomal enzymes can cause serious lysosomal diseases such as I-cell or Gaucher’s'."
            },
            {
                learningObjective: "LO1 (Cell Structure): Describe the basic ultrastructure of a prototypical human cell...",
                question: "A 58-year-old patient with a history of seizure disorder has been taking phenobarbital for many years. This drug is metabolized in the liver. Chronic administration leads to a notable proliferation of a specific organelle within hepatocytes, increasing the drug's rate of metabolism and leading to drug tolerance. Electron microscopy of this patient's liver cells would most likely show an abundance of which of the following?",
                options: { A: "Mitochondria", B: "Golgi apparatus", C: "Rough Endoplasmic Reticulum", D: "Smooth Endoplasmic Reticulum", E: "Lysosomes" },
                correctAnswer: "D",
                rationale: "The Smooth Endoplasmic Reticulum (SER) is the primary site of detoxification. Chronic exposure to certain drugs induces proliferation (hypertrophy) of the SER in hepatocytes to increase metabolic capacity. The RER synthesizes secreted proteins, Golgi modifies them, Mitochondria produce ATP, and Lysosomes are for degradation.",
                source: "Source (Cell Structure, Page 7): 'SER is chiefly involved with the metabolism of lipids, and the detoxification of drugs and poisons.'"
            },
            {
                learningObjective: "LO1 (Cell Structure): Describe the basic ultrastructure of a prototypical human cell...",
                question: "A 65-year-old man is diagnosed with multiple myeloma, a cancer characterized by the massive production of abnormal, misfolded immunoglobulins. The chemotherapy agent bortezomib is administered, which leads to apoptosis of the cancer cells by preventing the degradation of these accumulating toxic proteins. Bortezomib most likely inhibits the function of which of the following?",
                options: { A: "Lysosomes", B: "Peroxisomes", C: "Proteasomes", D: "Nucleolus", E: "Golgi apparatus" },
                correctAnswer: "C",
                rationale: "Bortezomib is a proteasome inhibitor. Proteasomes are responsible for the quality control of endogenously synthesized proteins, degrading misfolded or damaged ones. In multiple myeloma, inhibiting their degradation with bortezomib is cytotoxic to the cancer cells due to the buildup of toxic misfolded proteins. Lysosomes primarily degrade extracellular material or organelles.",
                source: "Source (Cell Structure, Page 11): The Clinical Relevance box states: 'Bortezomib, an inhibitor of proteasome function is used in the treatment of cancer.' The text explains proteasomes are involved in the 'quality control of endogenously synthesized proteins... and proteins that are folded incorrectly'."
            },
            {
                learningObjective: "LO2 (Cell Structure): Explain membrane lipid asymmetry...",
                question: "A researcher is studying apoptosis in a cell culture. They use fluorescently labeled annexin V, a protein that specifically binds to phosphatidylserine (PS), to identify cells in the early stages of programmed cell death. This detection method is effective because in early apoptosis, PS is found in which of the following locations?",
                options: { A: "The inner leaflet of the mitochondrial membrane", B: "The outer leaflet of the plasma membrane", C: "The lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum", D: "The cytosol, unbound to any membrane", E: "The inner leaflet of the plasma membrane" },
                correctAnswer: "B",
                rationale: "A key feature of a healthy plasma membrane is the confinement of phosphatidylserine (PS) to the inner (cytosolic) leaflet. During early apoptosis, a scramblase moves PS to the outer leaflet, where it acts as an 'eat me' signal for phagocytes. Annexin V specifically binds to this exposed PS.",
                source: "Source (Cell Structure, Page 15): 'During apoptosis (programmed cell death), the outer monolayer of the plasma membrane exhibits lipids that are typical of the inner monolayer.' and 'Surface display of PS provides several functions... including marking apoptotic cells for consumption by phagocytes'."
            },
            {
                learningObjective: "LO2 (Cell Structure): Explain membrane lipid asymmetry...",
                question: "The maintenance of the distinct phospholipid composition between the inner and outer leaflets of the plasma membrane is an energy-dependent process. An ATP-dependent transporter actively moves aminophospholipids, such as phosphatidylserine and phosphatidylethanolamine, from the extracellular leaflet to the cytosolic leaflet. This transporter is best classified as which of the following?",
                options: { A: "A flippase", B: "A floppase", C: "A scramblase", D: "A symporter", E: "A channel protein" },
                correctAnswer: "A",
                rationale: "Flippases are ATP-dependent transporters that move specific aminophospholipids (PS, PE) from the outer leaflet to the inner leaflet, generating and maintaining lipid asymmetry. Floppases also use ATP but move lipids in the opposite direction. Scramblases are ATP-independent and move lipids bidirectionally.",
                source: "Source (Cell Structure, Page 15): 'Flippases have substrate specificity to phosphatidyl serine and phosphatidyl choline and move these lipids to the inner monolayer (cytosolic).'"
            },
            {
                learningObjective: "LO2 (Cell Structure): Explain membrane lipid asymmetry...",
                question: "A patient with Scott syndrome, a rare bleeding disorder, is found to have platelets that fail to form a proper procoagulant surface upon activation. Normally, platelet activation causes a massive influx of Ca2+, which in turn activates a membrane protein that non-specifically and rapidly translocates phospholipids between the two leaflets, exposing phosphatidylserine. The defective protein in this patient is most likely which of the following?",
                options: { A: "A flippase", B: "A P-glycoprotein floppase", C: "A scramblase", D: "A G-protein coupled receptor", E: "The Na+/K+-ATPase" },
                correctAnswer: "C",
                rationale: "Scramblases are enzymes that, when activated by high intracellular Ca2+, randomize phospholipids between the membrane leaflets. On platelets, this is crucial for exposing phosphatidylserine, which provides a negatively charged surface necessary for blood coagulation. Flippases and floppases maintain, not dissipate, asymmetry.",
                source: "Source (Cell Structure, Page 16): 'This destruction of membrane asymmetry in cells is produced by the activation of a separate calcium-dependent scramblase... In the erythrocyte and platelet membranes these scramblases are activated after massive calcium entry and initiate blood coagulation.'"
            },
            {
                learningObjective: "LO3 (Cell Structure): Classify molecules with restricted diffusion across cell membranes...",
                question: "A pharmacologist is studying the transport of a new drug across a cell membrane. The transport rate increases with the extracellular concentration of the drug until it reaches a maximum velocity (Vmax). The process is highly specific for one stereoisomer of the drug and does not consume ATP. This drug most likely crosses the membrane via which mechanism?",
                options: { A: "Simple diffusion", B: "Channel-mediated facilitated diffusion", C: "Carrier-mediated facilitated diffusion", D: "Primary active transport", E: "Secondary active transport" },
                correctAnswer: "C",
                rationale: "The described characteristics are saturation kinetics (Vmax) and specificity, without energy use. Simple diffusion lacks a protein and thus has no saturation or specificity. Active transport requires energy. Carrier-mediated facilitated diffusion uses a limited number of carrier proteins that bind the solute, explaining specificity and saturation, while moving it down its concentration gradient without ATP.",
                source: "Source (Cell Structure, Page 18, 21): 'The term FACILITATED DIFFUSION... the transport process is highly specific to the solutes.' and 'when all of the proteins are bound to their ligands, they are saturated and the rate of transport is at its maximum.'"
            },
            {
                learningObjective: "LO3 (Cell Structure): Classify molecules with restricted diffusion across cell membranes...",
                question: "A patient with cystic fibrosis has a mutation in the CFTR gene, which codes for a protein that transports Cl- ions out of epithelial cells. This protein has a binding site for ATP, and the binding and hydrolysis of ATP are required to regulate the opening and closing of its pore. When open, it allows Cl- ions to move down their electrochemical gradient. The CFTR protein is best classified as which of the following?",
                options: { A: "A voltage-gated channel", B: "A ligand-gated (ATP-gated) channel", C: "A primary active transporter", D: "A secondary active transporter", E: "A mechanosensitive channel" },
                correctAnswer: "B",

                question: "Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and creatine kinase (CK) are examples of enzymes that exist as isoenzymes. Which of the following statements is a fundamental characteristic of isoenzymes?",
                options: { A: "They are encoded by the same gene but are modified differently after translation.", B: "They catalyze the same reaction but are encoded by different genes.", C: "They always have identical Km and Vmax values.", D: "They are found only in a single tissue type within an organism.", E: "They have identical primary amino acid sequences." },
                correctAnswer: "B",
                rationale: "The defining characteristic of isoenzymes (or isozymes) is that they are different molecular forms of an enzyme that catalyze the same chemical reaction. These differences arise because they are encoded by different genes, which may have arisen through gene duplication and divergence over evolutionary time. This leads to differences in their amino acid sequence, structure, kinetic properties (Km, Vmax), and tissue distribution.",
                source: "Source (AAs, Proteins, Enzymes, Page 11): 'Isoenzymes are different gene products (arising from different chromosomes). Thus, isozymes have different physico-chemical properties such as molecular mass, electrophoretic mobility, isoelectric pH, subunit composition, etc.'"
